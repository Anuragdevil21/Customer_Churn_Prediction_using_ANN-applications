# Customer_Churn_Prediction_using_ANN-applications


This project aims to predict customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The project includes data preprocessing, model training.

This code develops an artificial neural network model to perform binary classification on a bank customer churn dataset to predict whether a customer will leave the bank or not. It loads and preprocesses the dataset, does one-hot encoding of categorical variables, and develops and trains a simple multi-layer perceptron model using TensorFlow Keras with two hidden layers.This code develops an artificial neural network model to perform binary classification on a bank customer churn dataset to predict whether a customer will leave the bank or not.
